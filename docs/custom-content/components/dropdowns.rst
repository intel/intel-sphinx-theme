Dropdowns
=========

.. note::

    The dropdown component requires the `sphinx-design` extension. 
    Ensure it is installed and enabled in your Sphinx configuration.

Dropdowns look similar to admonitions, but they are clickable interactive elements that can be used to hide content.

See `the Sphinx Design Dropdown documentation <https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dropdowns.html>`__ for more information.
