##########

This project is focused on providing a comprehensive guide for users to effectively utilize the Spark Island themed version of the PyData Sphinx Theme.
The theme incorporates elements from the Spark Island Design System to deliver a visually appealing and consistent user experience,
making it an ideal choice for documentation and web projects that require a cohesive design with Intel branding.

This theme inherits from the `PyData Sphinx Theme version 0.15.4 <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/v0.15.4/>`_. The visual changes are made based on the `Spark Island Design System <https://spark-island.intel.com/>`_.

Spark Island is a design system aimed at assisting designers and developers in creating visually appealing
and functional software products with a consistent user experience. It provides a collection of tools, UI components,
and resources that align with Intel branding and prioritize accessibility. By using Spark Island, designers
and developers can ensure their projects have a cohesive design, receive regular updates, and have the ability
to contribute and adapt to evolving project requirements.
